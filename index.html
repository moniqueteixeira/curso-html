    <p><h1><font color="#FFFFFF">What is Lorem Ipsum?</font></h1>
    <b><font size="20px" face="verdana">Lorem Ipsum</font></b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <strong>industry</strong>. <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the <sub>1500s</sub>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged. <br> <sup>It</sup> was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
    Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <p><h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
    layout. <br> The point of using <u>orem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
    using 'Content here, content here', <em>making it look like readable English</em>. <br>Many desktop publishing packages and web
    page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
    sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
    purpose <I>injected humour and the like)</I>.</p>
